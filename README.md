# BadgeLifeTable2017
Badgelife Meet-up Table
Thanks to Whitney Merrill @wbm312, official cat herder par none, members of the #badgelife slack channel met in a too small room at Caesar's Palace on Thursday July 27th, 2017 - and we got pictures to prove it. This repository is a map of everything on the meet-up table.
Not every badge that made it's way to defcon is on the table, nor is every badge on the table necessarily a defcon indie. It's just the badges makers laid on the table.
Special thanks to Cat Murdock @catmurd0ck for the gorgeous photographs!
